		'Not wanting to stay out too late for dinner and ensuring I\'d be rested enough for the journey to Victoria, I found Frugal\'s, a fast food burger joint that proclaims itself to be the Best of the Northwest.  Located next door to the Days Inn I stayed at, I headed there on foot, only to realize it was only a drive-thru, so I walked back and hopped in my car.',
		'With two sides of the drive thru, even at 7:00 pm, there were plenty of cars in line.  Wanting something juicy, I got myself a burger in fries, and though I entered the left hand side of the drive thru, not realizing it would be a reach to grab my food on the opposite side of me, I was able to easily get my burger and fries, at a reasonable price of $5.96.  As I drove off, I was greeted with a Thank You sign in English, Clallam and another language (which also appeared to be Native American).',
		'After a hop skip of a drive back to my hotel room, I opened my burger and fries, enjoying each an every bite of it.  The burger was delicious and juicy, and along with the tasty french fries, it was the perfect meal to enjoy in your hotel room and watch basketball on the TV.  I also brought a little Pendleton Whiskey from home, which complemented the meal.  In all, a perfect easy meal.'

		'Located in downtown Victoria, I thought it would be a fun place to eat while researching online, so I had my lunch here.  I was expecting more of a Retro Cafe, the type where oldies jams would play on the jukebox.  I could envision my newly discovered Grandpa Buddy doing his best Fonz impression.  Entering the place, as soon as I walked up the stairs, I soon realized I would not be having that type of experience.  Instead, I found a nice friendly eatery with plenty of food options, drinks and all the pleasentries you would expect in Canada.',
		'Wanting to try a Canadian beer, not the kind you\'d find stacked with the Bud and Coors of the world, I opted for a Hoyne Pilsner, from a local craft brewery, to have something different.  A crisp summer beer seemed perfect for the type of weather outside.  Though the glass was frozen, the beer itself had a nice refreshing taste.  Sticking to wanting to have something different, I had a bowl of Chowder, which was presented nicely and tasted well also.',
		'When it was all said and done, I enjoyed my first Canadian meal, all at the price of 21.50 dollars, which of course, was its value in Canadian dollars.  After entering my debit card into a machine and answering a few questions on the handheld device, which was a little confusing due to its United States related questions, I got my receipt, which kindly told me that I only spent about 17.00 US Dollars.'

		'Making my way back to Port Angeles, tired from a long and fun day in Victoria, I again opted for a different food experience, finding a BBQ restaurant named Coyotes.  The building itself was kind of ambiguous, which made it not stand out particularly, but once I walked inside, I felt like I was in the Wild West.',
		'Starting with a beverage, I chose the classic but not a drink I usually have, a Sidecar.  Noted with having Remy Martin cognac, the cocktail was tasty.',
		'For dinner, I again opted for something less traditional than my usual food, so I ordered a Nacho plate with Chili.  The chili, according to the server, was a new recipe. With plenty of meats, beans and spices, it was delicious, which I assured the server it was.  It complemented the Nachos well, which contained cheese, salsa and jalapeños, among other things. The only downside was that I wasn’t able to finish the whole plate, stopping having eaten a good 90%.'

		'With an unexpected trip to Bremerton due to my Waze App suggesting I take the route through Kitsap County rather than US 101 and my desire to see something new and exciting, my plans for the day were completely spontaneous.  Even visiting Bremerton was completely unplanned; only after browing through my phone I settled on visiting the Bremerton Boardwalk.',
		'Unsure of where I wanted to eat, and not wanting to walk so much, my first two ideas went south; one place that looked cool was closed on Sundays, another place looked to classy for how I was feeling.  At least the seagulls were able to get a table.  Walking around the area near my car, I settled for a place called the Horse & Cow Bar & Grill, as I didn\'t want to spend too much time walking.',
		'Entering the Horse & Cow, I noticed the funky and gritty vibe.  Not super caring of where I sat, I entered the bar and ordered myself a Georgetown Brewing Bodhizafa IPA.  Gotta love that name.  Not the best IPA I\'ve had but nothing wrong with trying a new Seattle beer.  Again, trying to be adventurous and taking advantage of their Sunday Special, I ordered a $6.99 Steak and Fries.  It had been years since I had a steak.  The steak was satisfying, though not particularly superb, I had to teach myself how to properly cut and eat my steak.  I felt a little off before eating, but after lunch, I felt a lot better.  Mission accomplished.'
